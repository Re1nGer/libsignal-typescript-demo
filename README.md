# Demo React Application using the libsignal-protocol-typescript

This repository contains two sample applications using  [libsignal-protocol-typescript](https://github.com/privacyresearchgroup/libsignal-protocol-typescript):

* `./simple/`: A simple React app that operates entirely in the client, simulating the signal directory and message passing in memory. As you use the
application it provides code snippets and explanations of what is happening with each button press. This is the place to start to learn about 
developing applications with the Signal Protocol.
* `./signal-protocol-client`: A React client chat app that communicates with a backend for directory services and message delivery. This is a slightly more realistic example that adds
some state management and networking complexity.
